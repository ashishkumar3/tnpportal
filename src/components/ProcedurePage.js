Procedure for getting an on-campus placement:

Companies interested in hiring can register for the upcoming placement season either by submitting the registration form or by emailing the duly filled Job Announcement Form at tpo@igdtuw.ac.in.

An optimum slot will be allocated to the firm and necessary details will be provided as per company's requirement.

The Company visits the Campus on the scheduled date for a Pre-placement talk. The On-Campus procedure may be held on the same day or on a later date.

The company is expected to declare the final list of selects on the day of the On-Campus Process. If this is not possible, then the T&P department should be notified beforehand.

Once a student is selected in one company, she will not be allowed to appear for other companies' interviews as per the Recruitment Policy**.
